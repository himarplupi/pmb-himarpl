## Getting Started

The steps below will give you an overview of how to set up your local environment for the HIMARPL Ascendia Cabinet Website and the general steps to complete something and submit your contribution.

1. Click the fork button in the top right to copy the [HIMARPL New Student Admission Website Repository](https://github.com/himarplupi/pmb-himarpl/fork)

2. Clone your fork using SSH, GitHub CLI, or HTTPS.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:himarplupi/pmb-himarpl.git # SSH
   git clone https://github.com/himarplupi/pmb-himarpl.git # HTTPS
   gh repo clone himarplupi/pmb-himarpl # GitHub CLI
   ```

3. Change to the pmb-himarpl directory.

   ```bash
   cd pmb-himarpl
   ```

   1. **Prerequisites for .env file**: Create a `.env` file in the project root.

   2. Follow the getting started guide at [CoackroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/quickstart) for the `DATABASE_URL` value.

      ```bash
      DATABASE_URL=
      ```

4. Create a remote to sync your fork and local clone with the main repository.

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:himarplupi/pmb-himarpl.git # SSH
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/himarplupi/pmb-himarpl.git # HTTPS
   gh repo sync himarplupi/pmb-himarpl # GitHub CLI
   ```

5. Create a new branch for your work.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

6. Run the following commands to install dependencies and start a local preview of your work.

   ```bash
   npm ci # install project dependencies
   npm run db:push # push database schema to CockroachDB
   npm run dev # start development environment
   ```

7. Make your changes. If you're not familiar with this repository's structure, we recommend reading the [HIMARPL Documentation Website](https://docs.himarpl.com).

8. Merge to sync your current branch with the upstream branch.

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

9. Run `npm run lint` to ensure linting and formatting are correct.

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

10. Once you're satisfied with your changes, add and commit them to your branch, then push the branch to your fork.

    ```bash
    cd ~/ascendia-himarpl
    git add .
    git commit # Please follow the commit guidelines below
    git push -u origin your-branch-name
    ```
